# CyberStalker-Bridge

Based on the MQTT messaging protocol, CyberStalker Bridge facilitates the connection between remote locations requiring minimal code footprint and/or network bandwidth. Thanks to the wide range of various parameters and options, CyberStalker Bridge provides an exquisite opportunity for high volumes of sensor messages transferring within a specific infrastructure, e.g. Hitachi, Lenovo, HP, etc.
Its simplicity in implementation, zero (or near zero) administration and continuous session awareness features make CyberStalker Bridge a versatile and mighty tool for developers to use it regarding the infrastructures of a different type and scale.
